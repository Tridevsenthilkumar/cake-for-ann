ðŸŽ‚ Interactive Birthday Cake Project ðŸŽ‰ (Personalized for Ann)
Overview
This is a special, personalized web-based birthday cake application created to celebrate Ann. It features a fixed set of 18 candles that can be extinguished by blowing into the device's microphone, culminating in a custom message.

Motivation & Customization
Inspired by a creative design, this version has been customized for a specific birthday celebration.

Fixed Candle Count: The cake loads with exactly 18 candles (the number can be adjusted in script.js). The ability to add more candles has been removed.

Special Message: Once all 18 candles are successfully blown out, a heartfelt personal message appears on the screen.

Features
Personalized Experience: Loads automatically with 18 candles and a hidden "Happy Birthday Ann" message.

Microphone Integration: Blow into your mic to extinguish the candles ðŸŽ¤.

Dynamic Candle Count: Watch the candle count decrease as the flames go out ðŸ”¢.

Celebratory Finale: A special message appears when the countdown hits zero.
